# CropAI
# ðŸŒ± CropDoc AI â€“ Smart Agriculture Assistant

*CropDoc AI* is an integrated platform that combines *AI-powered leaf disease detection, **IoT-based environmental monitoring, and a **cross-platform mobile app* to help farmers monitor crop health in real time and get actionable treatment advice.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- *AI Leaf Disease Detection* â€“ Upload a leaf image and get the disease type, confidence %, and treatment recommendation.
- *IoT Sensor Integration* â€“ ESP32 reads temperature, humidity, and soil moisture from sensors and sends data to the backend.
- *Real-time Charts* â€“ View live sensor readings on the mobile app.
- *Cross-platform Mobile App* â€“ Built with React Native Expo, works on Android, iOS, and Web.
- *Local Network Communication* â€“ Mobile app and IoT device send data to backend over LAN.
- *Base64 Upload Support* â€“ Enables web compatibility for image uploads.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. *Train AI Model*
   - Train a MobileNetV2 model with transfer learning on a leaf disease dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Export the trained model as model.h5 and the class labels as labels.json.

2. *Backend (Flask)*
   - Loads the trained model and serves /predict-disease for image predictions.
   - Returns disease name, confidence %, and treatment recommendations.
   - Provides /sensor-data and /ingest-sensor endpoints for IoT devices.

3. *IoT Device (ESP32)*
   - Reads *temperature, **humidity, and **soil moisture* from sensors.
   - Sends readings to the backend every few seconds.

4. *Mobile App (React Native Expo)*
   - *Home Tab* â€“ Displays API base and navigation shortcuts.
   - *Live Sensors Tab* â€“ Fetches and displays real-time sensor data in charts.
   - *Leaf Scan Tab* â€“ Lets the user upload a leaf image and get disease predictions with confidence % and treatment.
